                    <h4>Osbert Parsley</h4>
                    <hr />

                    <p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>
                    <p>
                        Osbert Parsley(1510/1511 – 1585) was an English
                        <a href="">Renaissance</a> composer and
                        <a href="">chorister</a> Few details of his life are
                        known, but he evidently married in 1558, and lived for a
                        period in the parish of
                        <a href="">St Saviour's Church, Norwich</a>.A
                        <a href="">boy chorister</a> at
                        <a href="">Norwich Cathedral</a> , Parsley worked there
                        throughout his musical career. He was first mentioned as
                        a <a href="">lay clerk</a> , was appointed a "singing
                        man" in c. 1534, and was probably the cathedral's
                        unofficial organist for half a century. His career
                        spanned the reigns of <a href="">Henry VIII</a> and all
                        three of his children. After the
                        <a href="">Reformation</a> of 1534, the lives of English
                        church musicians changed according to the official
                        policy of each monarch.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Parsley wrote mainly church music for both the
                        <a href="">Latin</a> and English rites, as well as
                        instrumental music. His Latin settings are considered to
                        be more fluent and attractive-sounding than those he
                        wrote to be sung in English. His longest composition,
                        Conserva me, domine, was in a graceful polyphonic style.
                        Parsley's other <a href="">liturgical</a> works include
                        two <a href=""> Morning Services</a> , an Evening
                        Service, and the five-part Lamentations (notable for the
                        difficulty in singing the top notes of the highest
                        part). His instrumental music, nearly all for viols,
                        including six consort pieces, was written in a style
                        that combines both his Latin and English vocal styles.
                        Some of his incomplete instrumental music has survived.

                    <p>
                        Parsley died in <a href="">Norwich</a> in 1585 and was
                        buried in Norwich Cathedral. His
                        <a href="">commemorative plaque</a> , a mark of the
                        respect in which he was held by those who knew him, was
                        a unique honour for a chorister at the cathedral. The
                        plaque is inscribed with a poem praising his character
                        and musicianship. Parsley's music is occasionally heard
                        in church services and concerts. Compositions that have
                        been recorded include his Lamentations and Spes Nostra.
